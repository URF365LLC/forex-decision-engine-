# News trading

In phase 1, you can trade news without any restrictions.

In an E8 Trader account during the release of high-impact news, a prohibition period will be enforced. This period will commence 5 minutes before the scheduled news release and extend for 5 minutes after the release.

During the prohibition period, users are prohibited from:

a. Opening new trades (Market Execution/Limit orders).

b. Closing trades (Market Execution/Limit orders).

c. Stop/Loss and Take/Profit

d. Buy Stop and Sell Stop

**Please note that if any of the prohibited actions are executed within the 10-minute period (5 Minutes before and 5 minutes after) immediately before or after the event, any profits earned during this time will be subject to removal, without any account violation.**
