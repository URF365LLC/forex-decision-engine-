We recently completed a major UI/UX overhaul, and from a visual and design standpoint the platform looks excellent. However, before moving forward, I need a deep, senior-level, enterprise-grade audit to ensure that functionality, data integrity, and strategy execution are fully aligned with the new design.

This audit should cover frontend behavior, backend logic, data flow, and strategy execution end-to-end, with a strong focus on identifying bugs, inconsistencies, and areas for improvement—without unnecessary over-engineering.

Primary Objectives

UI/UX Functional Validation

Verify that all settings are functioning correctly, especially:

Account size registration

Persistence of settings

Correct propagation of account size into trade sizing and execution logic

Ensure that UI state changes accurately reflect backend state and vice versa.

Trade Interaction & Auto Scan Issues

Investigate and fix the issue where Auto Scan trades cannot be manually dismissed:

Identify why dismiss actions are erroring

Confirm correct state transitions (visible → dismissed → ignored)

Add a “Trade Taken” button that:

Registers the trade exactly as presented to the user

Automatically pushes the trade into the journal

Preserves all metadata (strategy, instrument, timeframe, confidence, etc.)

Trade Journal & Strategy Attribution

Implement tiered execution tracking, so that:

Partial fills or tiered entries are recorded correctly

All executions are linked back to the originating strategy

Ensure the journal supports per-strategy performance analysis, enabling accurate comparison of which strategies perform best over time.

Dashboard & Sidebar Bug (Instruments List)

Investigate the sidebar instrument selector bug where:

The instrument count starts at a fixed number (e.g., 19)

Clicking instruments causes inconsistent add/remove behavior

Identify whether this is caused by:

UI state desync

Incorrect list mutation

Index/key mismatches

Backend response inconsistencies

Provide a clear fix and prevention strategy.

End-to-End Platform Audit
Conduct a full audit of:

Frontend architecture

State management

Component responsibilities

UI → API → response flow

Backend architecture

Strategy engine

Trade lifecycle handling

Journaling and persistence

Data flow integrity

From user input → strategy evaluation → signal generation → execution → journaling

Ensure no silent failures, stale data, or mismatched assumptions

Auto Scan vs Manual Scan parity

Confirm both paths behave consistently and share the same core logic

Strategy-Level Deep Dive

Audit each strategy individually:

Verify it is isolated and not leaking state into others

Confirm correct interaction with the strategy engine

Evaluate whether the strategy is:

mathematically sound

implemented as intended

at its “best possible” version given its hypothesis

Identify targeted, high-impact improvements where appropriate:

No unnecessary complexity

No overfitting

Preserve the original intent of each strategy

Required Deliverables

A) Executive Summary

High-level platform health

Key blockers and risks

Production readiness assessment

B) UI/UX Functional Findings

What works

What’s broken

Why it’s broken

How to fix it

C) Trade & Journal System Review

Dismiss logic

Trade Taken flow

Tiered execution handling

Strategy attribution correctness

D) Strategy Audit Report

One section per strategy:

Purpose

Strengths

Weaknesses

Integration quality

Recommended improvements (if any)

E) Data Flow & Architecture Map

Clear explanation of how frontend, backend, and strategy engine interact

Identification of fragile or error-prone links

F) Fix & Improvement Plan

Prioritized roadmap:

Immediate bug fixes

Short-term stability improvements

Medium-term strategy and architecture enhancements

Acceptance criteria for each item

Constraints & Expectations

Do not assume correctness—validate with code.

Tie findings to concrete evidence (files, functions, data paths).

Prefer clarity, correctness, and robustness over feature expansion.

Treat this as an enterprise readiness review, not a cosmetic pass.

Final Goal

The goal is to walk away with complete confidence in:

the UI/UX behaving exactly as intended,

the backend enforcing correct logic and data integrity,

the strategy engine being well-isolated, measurable, and optimizable,

and the platform being truly ready for production-scale usage.
