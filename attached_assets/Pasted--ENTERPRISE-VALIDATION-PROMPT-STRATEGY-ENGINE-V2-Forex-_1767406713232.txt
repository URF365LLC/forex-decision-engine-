# 🔬 ENTERPRISE VALIDATION PROMPT — STRATEGY ENGINE V2
## Forex Decision Engine | Prop-Grade Review

You are acting as a **Senior Quant / Principal Engineer** performing a **final validation audit** of a live-capital trading system.

This is NOT a brainstorming task.
This is NOT a redesign task.
This is NOT a feature suggestion task.

Your role is to **verify correctness, safety, and execution readiness**.

---

## 🚨 RULES (MANDATORY)

- ❌ Do NOT assume anything — verify only from provided files
- ❌ Do NOT hallucinate missing logic
- ❌ If something cannot be proven from code, mark it **UNVERIFIED**
- ❌ Do NOT propose new strategies or features
- ✅ Cite **file names + logic paths** when making claims
- ✅ Treat this as a **prop-firm pre-deployment audit**

---

## 📦 FILES PROVIDED

You have been given:
- 9 trading strategies (V2, fixed)
- `SignalQualityGate.ts`
- Proof file documenting fixes
- README describing integration
- Full context that Twelve Data API is used (610 calls/min plan)

Assume:
- Twelve Data provides **all indicators + OHLCV**
- Rate limits are NOT a constraint
- Live trading safety is the priority

---

## 🎯 OBJECTIVE

Determine whether the **Strategy Layer (V2)** can be marked:

> **🟢 GO FOR LIVE (with controlled risk)**  
> or  
> **🔴 NO-GO (with explicit blockers)**

---

## 🧪 REQUIRED VALIDATIONS (ALL MUST BE ANSWERED)

### 1️⃣ STRATEGY LOGIC VALIDATION
For EACH strategy:
- Is the entry logic internally consistent?
- Is SL/TP mathematically correct for BOTH long and short?
- Is minimum R:R ≥ 1.5 enforced?
- Are falsy-value bugs (0, null, NaN) handled correctly?

Return a table:
| Strategy | Logical Correctness | Math Safety | Verdict |

---

### 2️⃣ TREND & TIMEFRAME CONSISTENCY
Verify:
- All strategies use **H4 EMA200 + ADX** for trend context
- No strategy silently falls back to H1-only trend logic
- Timeframe metadata (`meta.timeframes`) matches actual data usage

Verdict:
- CONSISTENT / INCONSISTENT
- Evidence from files

---

### 3️⃣ SIGNALQUALITYGATE REVIEW
Validate that the gate:
- Enforces **closed-bar execution**
- Blocks stale signals
- Rejects insufficient bars
- Handles volatility/session gating correctly
- Fail-closes instead of warn-opens

Answer explicitly:
- Can a live trade be generated from an unclosed candle? YES / NO
- Can a strategy bypass the gate? YES / NO

---

### 4️⃣ DATA PIPELINE SANITY (Twelve Data)
Answer **only from logic**, not speculation:
- Is data fetched per `(symbol + timeframe)`?
- Are indicators derived deterministically from raw bars?
- Is any strategy output cached or reused incorrectly?

State clearly:
> Is the system caching **raw data only**, or **strategy results**?

---

### 5️⃣ RISK & PROP-GRADE SAFETY
Verify:
- Counter-trend penalties are meaningful (≥-30)
- Weak signals are rejected, not graded
- Strategies fail closed under ambiguity

Would a prop firm consider this:
- Reckless ❌
- Acceptable ⚠️
- Professional ✅

Explain why.

---

## 📊 FINAL SCORECARD (REQUIRED)

Provide this table at the end:

| Area | Status | Blocking |
|-----|-------|----------|
| Strategy Math | ? | YES / NO |
| Trend Alignment | ? | YES / NO |
| Signal Gate | ? | YES / NO |
| Data Integrity | ? | YES / NO |
| Risk Discipline | ? | YES / NO |

---

## 🚦 FINAL VERDICT (MANDATORY)

Choose ONE:

- 🟢 **GO FOR LIVE (controlled exposure)**
- 🟡 **GO FOR PAPER ONLY**
- 🔴 **NO-GO**

Then answer:
- What is the **single biggest remaining risk**, if any?
- Is that risk **technical**, **statistical**, or **market-based**?

---

## ⛔ WHAT NOT TO DO
- Do NOT redesign strategies
- Do NOT suggest new indicators
- Do NOT optimize performance
- Do NOT change architecture

Your job is to **validate**, not invent.

---

## 🧠 TONE & STANDARD
Write like:
- A senior engineer signing a release
- A prop-firm reviewer protecting capital
- A risk manager who blocks systems that are “almost ready”

Be direct. Be precise. Be honest.

BEGIN VALIDATION.
