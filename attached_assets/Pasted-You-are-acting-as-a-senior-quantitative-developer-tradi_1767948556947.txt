You are acting as a senior quantitative developer, trading-systems architect, and independent strategy auditor. Your responsibility is to perform a full quantitative audit of all trading strategies implemented in the system and produce an executive-grade, evidence-backed evaluation.

This is not marketing documentation.
It is a quantitative correctness review, data integrity assessment, and comparative strength/weakness analysis of the strategies as they are actually implemented in code.

The output must be user-readable, but every statement must be:

mathematically sound,

faithful to the implementation,

defensible under internal audit or regulatory scrutiny.

If stated intent, UI descriptions, or expectations conflict with the code, the code is the source of truth.

Primary Objectives

For every trading strategy, you must:

Verify that the strategy’s quantification is mathematically sound

Validate that indicator math, data usage, and signal logic are correct

Identify strengths, weaknesses, and failure modes

Compare strategies relative to each other (where each performs best/worst)

Identify whether and how each strategy can be improved without violating its core hypothesis

Scope (Quant + Dev — Non-Negotiable)

For EACH strategy, document and evaluate the following sections in the same order.

1) Strategy Overview — Intent vs Implementation

Strategy name

One-paragraph description of the market hypothesis

Market behavior targeted:

trend

mean reversion

breakout

volatility expansion / contraction

Best-suited conditions:

timeframes

volatility regimes (e.g., ATR percentile ranges)

liquidity assumptions

Explicit failure modes:

chop

regime transitions

news-driven volatility

low-liquidity sessions

Audit Requirement

Explicitly state whether the implementation matches the stated hypothesis

Call out divergences, shortcuts, or incomplete realizations of intent

2) Inputs & Indicators — Mathematical Soundness

Raw data inputs:

OHLCV

order book / spread

derived volatility

sentiment (if applicable)

Indicators used, with exact formulas:

e.g.

EMA_t = α·Price_t + (1−α)·EMA_(t−1)

ATR = EMA(TrueRange, n)

RSI = 100 − (100 / (1 + RS))

Default parameters:

lookback windows

smoothing constants

Quantitative justification:

why each lookback length matters

sensitivity to parameter changes

Code references:

file paths

functions

parameter definitions

Audit Requirement

Identify mathematically weak, redundant, or misused indicators

Flag indicators that do not meaningfully contribute to signal quality

3) Signal Logic — Execution Accuracy

Step-by-step signal generation:

indicator computation

normalization (if any)

filters and gates

final decision logic

Entry conditions:

exact boolean logic for long/short

Exit conditions:

stop-loss formulas

take-profit logic

trailing mechanisms

time-based exits

Filters:

regime filters

liquidity filters

cooldown logic

Confidence scoring:

formula or heuristic

numeric range

how confidence alters execution or alerts

Include pseudocode where it clarifies logic.

Audit Requirement

Identify logical flaws, overlapping conditions, or redundant gates

Call out any logic that appears correct syntactically but is ineffective in practice

4) Trade Management — Risk & Robustness

Position sizing assumptions:

fixed % risk

volatility-scaled sizing

Stop placement logic:

ATR-based (e.g., k × ATR)

structure-based

Take-profit methods:

fixed R:R

trailing

partial exits

Conditions under which trades should not be taken

Conservative (“beginner-safe”) presets

Audit Requirement

Identify mismatches between signal volatility and risk controls

Highlight cases where trade management undermines the strategy’s edge

5) Invalidation Rules — Failure Detection

Explicit invalidation criteria:

indicator breakdowns

structure violations

regime flips

What a failed setup looks like

Post-failure behavior:

cooldown duration

re-entry logic

Edge cases:

flat markets

indicator saturation

sudden volatility spikes

partial-bar effects

Audit Requirement

Identify scenarios where the strategy should invalidate but does not

Identify over-aggressive invalidation that reduces opportunity

6) Examples, Edge Cases & Misuse

For each strategy, provide at least:

Textbook Valid Setup

why the setup works

how confidence reflects quality

Failed / Misleading Setup

why it fails

early warning signs

what the user should do

Include:

common user misinterpretations

confusing UI signals

warnings or confidence degradations users tend to ignore

7) Configuration & Sensitivity Analysis

User-adjustable parameters

Sensitivity analysis:

effect of shortening lookbacks

effect of loosening thresholds

Safe vs unsafe parameter ranges

Conservative / Balanced / Aggressive presets

Parameters that should not be changed without deep understanding

Audit Requirement

Identify parameter ranges that break mathematical assumptions

Flag settings that produce misleading or unstable signals

Cross-Strategy Comparison (Mandatory)

After auditing all strategies, provide a comparative analysis:

Strengths vs weaknesses of each strategy

Market regimes where each strategy excels or fails

Overlapping strategies (redundancy)

Gaps in coverage (missing market behaviors)

Relative robustness to noise, volatility, and liquidity

Include a strategy ranking by:

robustness

clarity of edge

sensitivity to parameters

suitability for novice vs advanced users

Deliverable Format
1) Strategy Summary Table
Strategy	Type	Best Conditions	Indicators	Strengths	Weaknesses	Risk
2) Individual Strategy Audit Pages

Use a fixed, repeatable template with the sections above.

3) Improvement Recommendations

For each strategy:

What can be improved

Why it helps quantitatively

Risk of change

Whether it preserves the original hypothesis

4) Glossary

Indicators

Regime definitions

Confidence scoring

Warning messages

Constraints

No hand-waving

No marketing language

No assumptions without code evidence

Treat this as:

internal audit documentation

user education

regulatory-ready explanation

Final Objective

Produce a quant-grade strategy audit and comparison such that:

Every strategy’s edge, limitations, and mathematical validity are explicitly understood — and any unexpected production behavior can be explained, justified, or corrected.

Now perform the audit and deliver the full report.
