What are the contract sizes?

# What are the contract sizes?

Updated over a year ago

Contract size, indicating the number of units bought or sold in a single nominal lot, varies by instrument type (e.g., Forex: 100,000 units; indices: 5-500 units) and is crucial for calculating risk management and expectancy; refer to our trading instrument list to accurately set take-profits and stop-losses.

* * *

XAUUSD contract size - 100 - you will lose or make 100 dollars per 1 dollar movement (1 lot)

﻿US30 / NAS100 contract size - 5 - you will lose or make 5 dollars per 1 dollar movement (1 lot)

﻿Sp500 contract size - 20 - you will lose or make 20 dollars per 1 dollar movement (1 lot)

**Example:**

There is an order of 5 lots on XAUUSD where the open price is 2324.00 and the close price is 2326.40, the total profit is 1200 USD.

​

​ **Calculation:**

The total movement: 2.4 USD

Contract size:100

Number of lots: 5

​

2.4 (Movement in USD) \* 100 (Contract size) \* 5 (Number of lots)= 1200 USD
