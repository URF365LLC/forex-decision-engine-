You are acting as a Principal Systems Architect and Senior Full-Stack Engineer conducting a comprehensive, end-to-end system audit. Your objective is to identify any major issues, risks, or gaps across the entire platform—from the initial user or system call, through the backend processing and data pipeline, all the way to signal generation, display, and persistence.

This review should be conducted at an enterprise and executive level, focusing on correctness, data integrity, architectural soundness, and production readiness.

Scope of Review (Do Not Skip)

1) End-to-End Flow Analysis

Trace the complete lifecycle:

Initial call / trigger (user action, auto scan, scheduler, API)

Backend processing and business logic

Strategy and signal computation

Data transformation, caching, and storage

Signal delivery and display in the UI

Identify any breakpoints, implicit assumptions, or fragile handoffs.

2) Frontend Audit

Evaluate UI state management and data binding.

Identify bugs, race conditions, stale state, or inconsistent rendering.

Validate loading, error, and empty states.

Confirm user actions map correctly to backend outcomes.

3) Backend Audit

Review service boundaries, data contracts, and domain logic placement.

Identify silent failures, swallowed errors, or incomplete validation.

Evaluate performance risks and concurrency issues.

Confirm configuration, environment handling, and feature flags are correct.

4) Data Pipeline & Integrity

Validate correctness and alignment of data throughout the pipeline.

Identify bottlenecks, duplication, or unnecessary recomputation.

Confirm schemas, transformations, and storage models are consistent and enforced.

Assess risk of stale, misaligned, or corrupted data.

5) Signal Generation & Display

Validate signal calculation logic and gating mechanisms.

Ensure signals displayed to users accurately reflect backend decisions.

Identify mismatches between computed signals and UI representation.

Confirm traceability from raw data → signal → displayed output.

6) Architecture & Technical Debt

Identify legacy or deprecated code paths.

Call out areas of tight coupling, unclear ownership, or architectural drift.

Recommend cleanup, refactoring, or rewiring where necessary.

Required Deliverables

A) Executive Summary

Overall system health and readiness

Key findings and risks (P0 / P1 / P2)

High-impact areas requiring attention

B) End-to-End Flow Map

High-level system and data-flow overview

Identification of fragile or high-risk handoffs

C) Findings & Evidence
For each major issue:

Description of the problem

Root cause analysis

Impact assessment

Evidence (file paths, functions, data flows)

Recommended fix or improvement

D) Frontend vs Backend Findings

Clearly separate frontend issues from backend issues

Identify cross-cutting concerns affecting both

E) Remediation Roadmap

Immediate fixes

Short-term improvements

Structural or architectural changes

Constraints & Expectations

Do not assume correctness—verify through analysis.

Avoid superficial feedback; focus on system-level risks.

Tie recommendations to architectural reasoning and system impact.

Write in a professional, executive-readable tone.

Final Objective

Deliver a clear, executive-level report that answers:

“What are the major issues across our frontend, backend, and data pipeline—from the initial call to signal display—and what must be done to ensure correctness, reliability, and scalability?”
