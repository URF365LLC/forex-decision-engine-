You are acting as an independent, third-party engineering auditor at a Principal / Staff engineer level. A prior GPT “3rd Outside Audit” has already reviewed this repository. Your task is to compare that audit against the current codebase, validate what is truly implemented, and provide an executive-level, evidence-based assessment.

Primary Objective

Determine whether the Regime and Liquidity engines/detectors are:

Present in the codebase

Correctly wired into the live execution path

Executing at runtime with real data

Influencing system decisions (signal gating, confidence scoring, eligibility, alerts, or execution)

Consistent across Auto Scan and Manual Scan workflows

Each of the above must be answered explicitly as YES or NO, with supporting evidence.

Scope of Analysis (Do Not Skip)

1. Audit Comparison

Review the findings and assumptions from the prior GPT “3rd Outside Audit.”

Compare them against the current repository state.

Identify which findings are:

Fully implemented

Partially implemented

Missing, broken, or regressed

Call out any discrepancies between documented intent and actual behavior.

2. Wiring Verification (Proof Required)
For both Regime and Liquidity engines, identify and document:

Where they are imported

Where they are invoked

Where their outputs are consumed and influence behavior

Include file paths and line numbers for each.
If any of these three links is missing, the engine must be classified as not wired.

3. Functional Validation

Confirm the engines execute during real runs (Auto Scan and Manual Scan).

Verify that their outputs materially affect decisions (block trades, adjust confidence, gate execution, etc.).

Identify default/fallback behavior, bypasses, or ignored return values that neutralize their impact.

4. Data Integrity & Alignment

Verify that Regime and Liquidity engines consume the same aligned market data (bars, timeframes, lookbacks) as the indicators they are intended to gate.

Identify risks related to bar misalignment, stale caches, partial bars, or inconsistent inputs.

Confirm that caching does not cause cross-strategy or Auto/Manual contamination.

Required Deliverables

A) Executive Verdict

Regime Engine: Wired / Working / Influencing Decisions / Auto-Manual Parity (YES/NO)

Liquidity Engine: Same evaluation

High-level risk assessment if either is incomplete or non-functional

B) Evidence Summary

Concrete code references (file paths + line numbers)

Clear trace: import → execution → decision impact

C) Gap Analysis

What exists vs what is missing

Why the current state does or does not meet production expectations

D) Integration or Remediation Plan (If Needed)

Minimal, safe steps to fully wire and validate the engines

Where changes must occur

How to prevent regression

How to prove correctness post-integration (tests, logs, metrics)

Constraints

Do not assume correctness—use code as the source of truth.

Avoid speculative or generic answers.

If information from the prior audit is missing, state what is needed explicitly and proceed with repository-based verification.

The outcome should be a clear, executive-ready answer to the question:
“Are our Regime and Liquidity engines truly wired, working, and trustworthy in production?”
