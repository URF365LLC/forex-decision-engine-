You are auditing an existing TypeScript codebase: forex-decision-engine.
Goal: Compare implemented strategies vs PROP-GRADE-STRATEGY-STANDARD.md and STRATEGY-AUDIT.md and report compliance, bugs, and exact patch diffs.

SCOPE:
- Strategies folder: all strategy files (9 total)
- Shared utilities: validateIndicators, validateOrder, atIndex, buildDecision, position sizing
- Any modules referenced by strategies: trendBarsH4, ema200H4, adxH4, session filter, volatility gate

TASKS (DO NOT SUMMARIZE — SHOW CODE):
1) For EACH strategy:
   A) List meta.requiredIndicators and meta.timeframes (if missing, flag)
   B) Identify trend filter source:
      - Is trend H4 EMA200 + ADX per standard? If not, flag as non-compliant.
   C) Verify minBars:
      - If strategy uses EMA200 or H4 trend, require minBars >= 250. If lower, flag.
   D) Verify entry model:
      - Show signalIdx and entryIdx logic and whether it uses CLOSED bar for signal and a deterministic entry.
   E) Verify SL/TP math:
      - Show SL formula and TP formula.
      - Compute theoretical RR = |TP-entry| / |entry-SL| and confirm >= strategy minimum.
      - If any conditional caps modify TP (ex: BB middle cap), re-check RR after the cap.
   F) Verify counter-trend handling:
      - Must apply standard penalty (-30) or reject per strategy type.
   G) Output: verdict per strategy: PASS / FAIL, with exact file+line+code blocks.

2) Cross-strategy consistency checks:
   - All strategies must use same trend framework definition.
   - Confidence scoring must use the same point constants.
   - Session filter + volatility gate must exist and be applied consistently (or explain why not).

3) Produce:
   - A compliance matrix table:
     Strategy | H4 Trend | Session Gate | Volatility Gate | minBars>=250 | RR enforced | Counter-trend rule | timeframes meta | Verdict
   - A patch plan ordered by severity (critical -> high -> medium)
   - For each critical fix: provide a ready-to-paste code diff.

CONSTRAINTS:
- No assumptions. If a requirement is not implemented, mark FAIL.
- If behavior depends on data ordering (oldest/newest), locate where bars are sorted/reversed and cite the exact lines.
