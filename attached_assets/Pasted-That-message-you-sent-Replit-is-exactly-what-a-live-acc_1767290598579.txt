That message you sent Replit is **exactly** what a live-account owner should send. It forces them to prove comprehension before they touch a single line. ✅

A couple “sharp edges” you might want to add (or keep in your pocket if they respond vaguely):

### 1) Add a hard constraint: Twelve-only enforcement

You already care about this—make them explicitly confirm:

* **No imports** from `alphaVantageClient`, `kucoinClient`, or any legacy data source
* Any legacy files remain **tripwired** or unused
* The RSI work **must not** reintroduce a second data path

Add one sentence if you want:

> “Confirm RSI Oversold uses the same Twelve-only pipeline and does not introduce any new data source or interval string.”

### 2) Force them to prove the H4/H1 availability (this is the one real trap)

Your locked RSI Oversold spec depends on **H4 EMA200 + H4 ADX**, but your current indicator service historically used **daily** for trend and **60min** for entry (especially for metals). Make Replit show:

* **Where H4 bars are fetched**
* Where **EMA200(H4)** and **ADX(H4)** are fetched
* If they’re not currently fetched, they must propose an explicit plan:

  * either add H4 trend fetching, OR
  * revise the spec to “trend = H1 EMA200” (I don’t recommend changing spec, but it’s the honest fallback)

Your Section 6 already asks this — good. Don’t let them hand-wave it.

### 3) Make them include a “no-lookahead” proof

Because NEXT_OPEN is sacred:

* Confirm `signalIdx = bars.length - 2`
* Confirm all indicators used are aligned and only read at `signalIdx` (not `entryIdx`)

You asked for it. If they slip, call it out.

### 4) Require a fail-fast “No NaN in last N bars” check

For RSI Oversold (and honestly all strategies):

* **Reject if RSI/ATR/ADX are NaN in last 10 bars**
* This prevents “warmup NaN” from generating garbage signals

You already used this earlier in the Twelve migration—keep it consistent.

## What I need from you *next*

Paste Replit’s execution report when they respond.
I’ll do the skeptical, live-account review in the exact format you asked earlier:

* Overall verdict
* Task-by-task
* Crypto/commission/timing risks (if touched)
* “Must fix before implementation” list

Until then, your instruction to Replit is solid—no edits required.
