STOP. Before implementing, provide a detailed execution plan for review.

I need to validate your understanding of the RSI strategy updates before approving the build. Three AI systems (Claude and ChatGPT) have validated this work - I need to confirm you understand it correctly.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
PRODUCE A DETAILED EXECUTION REPORT COVERING:
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

SECTION 1: TASK SUMMARY
- List all tasks in execution order
- Dependencies between tasks
- Estimated time per task
- Risk level per task (LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH)

SECTION 2: ReasonCode TYPE UPDATE (Task 1)

Show:
- File path where ReasonCode is defined
- Current ReasonCode type (full list)
- Exact change being made
- Which strategies currently use ReasonCode
- Any risk of breaking existing code?

SECTION 3: rsiBounce.ts UPDATE (Task 2)

Show a DIFF of changes:
- Line-by-line what's changing
- What's NOT changing (confirm core logic preserved)

Confirm understanding of each fix:

| Fix | Current Code | New Code | Why |
|-----|--------------|----------|-----|
| timeframes in meta | ? | ? | ? |
| Type cast | ? | ? | ? |
| NaN-safe gating | ? | ? | ? |
| Missing reason codes | ? | ? | ? |
| RR threshold | ? | ? | ? |

Confirm these are NOT being changed:
- [ ] RSI < 30 / > 70 thresholds
- [ ] Bollinger Band touch requirement
- [ ] SMA20 as trend reference
- [ ] Stop loss: 1.5 × ATR
- [ ] Take profit: 2.0 × ATR
- [ ] Core mean-reversion philosophy

SECTION 4: rsiOversold.ts CREATION (Task 3)

Show the FULL implementation you plan to create.

Verify against locked spec:

| Requirement | Your Implementation | Line # |
|-------------|---------------------|--------|
| H4 EMA200 trend filter | ? | ? |
| H4 ADX > 20 | ? | ? |
| RSI lookback (3 bars) | ? | ? |
| RSI turning (rsi > rsiPrev) | ? | ? |
| RSI recovery zone (30-50 / 50-70) | ? | ? |
| Volatility filter (1.8×ATR) | ? | ? |
| Swing-based stop (10 bar lookback) | ? | ? |
| Stop fallback (1.5×ATR) | ? | ? |
| Stop rejection (>2.0×ATR) | ? | ? |
| Min R:R 2.0 (reject if less) | ? | ? |
| NEXT_OPEN execution | ? | ? |
| signalIdx = bars.length - 2 | ? | ? |
| A+ grade: RSI < 25 AND ADX > 25 | ? | ? |

Show the meta object:
```typescript
meta: StrategyMeta = {
  id: ?,
  name: ?,
  description: ?,
  style: ?,
  timeframes: ?,
  winRate: ?,
  avgRR: ?,
  signalsPerWeek: ?,
  requiredIndicators: ?,
  version: ?,
};
```

Show the reason codes you'll use:
- Long signal reasons: ?
- Short signal reasons: ?
- Rejection reasons: ?

SECTION 5: REGISTRY UPDATE (Task 4)

Show:
- Current registry.ts imports
- New import to add
- Current strategies array
- New strategies array (with RsiOversold added)
- index.ts export changes

SECTION 6: INDICATOR REQUIREMENTS

For rsiOversold.ts, confirm data availability:

| Indicator | Timeframe | Currently Fetched? | Source |
|-----------|-----------|-------------------|--------|
| EMA200 | H4 | ? | ? |
| ADX | H4 | ? | ? |
| RSI | H1 | ? | ? |
| ATR | H1 | ? | ? |
| OHLCV bars | H1 | ? | ? |

If H4 data not currently available:
- What's the fallback plan?
- How will trend filter work without H4?

SECTION 7: DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO STRATEGIES

Explain in your own words:

| Aspect | RsiBounce | RsiOversold |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| Strategy type | ? | ? |
| Market condition | ? | ? |
| Trend filter | ? | ? |
| RSI usage | ? | ? |
| Bollinger Bands | ? | ? |
| ADX usage | ? | ? |
| Expected win rate | ? | ? |
| Trade frequency | ? | ? |
| When it fires | ? | ? |

Why do we need BOTH strategies?

SECTION 8: SMOKE TEST PLAN

For each test, specify:
- Endpoint
- Request body
- Expected response structure
- Pass criteria
- Fail criteria

Test 1: RsiBounce unchanged behavior
Test 2: RsiOversold new strategy works
Test 3: Both appear in scan results
Test 4: CANDLE_CONFIRMATION reason code works

SECTION 9: ROLLBACK PLAN

If something breaks:
- How to revert rsiBounce.ts?
- How to remove rsiOversold.ts?
- How to revert registry.ts?
- How to revert ReasonCode type?

SECTION 10: POTENTIAL RISKS

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| ? | ? | ? | ? |
