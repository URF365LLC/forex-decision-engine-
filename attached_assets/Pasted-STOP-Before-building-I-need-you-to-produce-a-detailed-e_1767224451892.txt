STOP. Before building, I need you to produce a detailed execution plan for my review.

This is a critical migration from Alpha Vantage to Twelve Data. I have two other AI systems (Claude and ChatGPT) that have cross-validated the architecture. Before I approve the build, I need YOU to demonstrate full understanding.

PRODUCE A DETAILED EXECUTION PLAN that includes:

1. CURRENT STATE ANALYSIS
   - List every file that currently imports alphaVantageClient
   - List every file that currently imports kucoinClient  
   - List every file that currently imports cryptoIndicatorService
   - Show the current data flow: factory → service → client → strategies

2. TARGET STATE ARCHITECTURE
   - Describe the new unified data flow (Twelve-only)
   - Explain why crypto no longer needs separate handling
   - Explain the exchange parameter strategy for crypto consistency

3. FILE-BY-FILE CHANGE MANIFEST
   For each file being modified, list:
   - File path
   - Current state (what it does now)
   - Changes required (line-by-line if possible)
   - New state (what it will do after)
   - Risk level (low/medium/high)

4. NEW FILES TO CREATE
   - twelveDataClient.ts: List all exported functions/types
   - Any other new files

5. INTERFACE CONTRACTS
   - Show the IndicatorData interface BEFORE and AFTER
   - Show the StrategyIndicatorData interface BEFORE and AFTER
   - Confirm all indicator arrays will align with bars.length

6. INDICATOR COVERAGE MATRIX
   Show a table:
   | Indicator | Alpha Vantage | Twelve Data | Period | Used By Strategy |
   
   Include: RSI, EMA (8,20,21,50,55,200), SMA (20,50,200), ATR, ADX, MACD, BBands, Stoch, WillR, CCI, OBV

7. SYMBOL NORMALIZATION RULES
   Show exactly how each symbol type will be normalized:
   - Forex: EURUSD → ?
   - Crypto: BTCUSD → ?
   - Metals: XAUUSD → ?
   - Stocks: AAPL → ?

8. ERROR HANDLING & RETRY STRATEGY
   - Describe the retry logic for transient failures
   - Describe what happens when an indicator returns fewer points than bars

9. ROLLBACK PLAN
   - How do we revert if something breaks?
   - What files are kept as backup?

10. VALIDATION CHECKLIST
    - List the exact smoke tests to run post-implementation
    - What constitutes PASS vs FAIL for each test?

11. POTENTIAL RISKS & MITIGATIONS
    - What could go wrong?
    - How is each risk mitigated?

Do NOT start building until I review and approve this plan.
