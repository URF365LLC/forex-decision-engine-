You are acting as a senior quantitative developer and trading-systems architect, with responsibility for producing a user-facing Strategy Guide / Explanation Menu that is mathematically correct, implementation-faithful, and production-safe.

This guide must be understandable by end users, but every statement must remain fully consistent with the actual codebase, indicator math, execution logic, and system constraints. Treat this as both documentation and implicit validation of the strategies.

Primary Objective

For every trading strategy implemented in the system, produce a complete, quant-accurate breakdown that explains:

What the strategy is designed to exploit (market hypothesis)

How signals are calculated, including formulas and thresholds

How trades should be executed and managed

When and why the strategy becomes invalid or unreliable

How to correctly interpret signals, confidence scores, and quality gates

What assumptions and edge cases exist

If the code contradicts expectations, the code wins.

Scope (Quant + Dev, Non-Negotiable)

For EACH strategy, document the following sections in the same order.

1) Strategy Overview (Intent vs Reality)

Strategy name

One-paragraph description of the market hypothesis

Market behavior targeted:

trend

mean reversion

breakout

volatility expansion/contraction

Best-suited conditions:

timeframes

volatility regimes (e.g., ATR percentile ranges)

liquidity assumptions

Explicit failure modes:

chop

regime transitions

news volatility

low-volume sessions

Include a note if the strategy’s actual implementation diverges from its stated intent.

2) Inputs & Indicators (Exact, Not Approximate)

Raw inputs

OHLCV

order book / spread

derived volatility

sentiment (if applicable)

Indicators used, with formulas:

e.g.

EMA_t = α·Price_t + (1−α)·EMA_(t−1)

ATR = EMA(TrueRange, n)

RSI = 100 − (100 / (1 + RS))

Default parameters and where they are defined:

lookback lengths

smoothing constants

Why each lookback matters quantitatively

File paths / function names where indicators are calculated

3) Signal Logic (Execution-Accurate)

Step-by-step signal flow:

indicator computation

normalization (if any)

gating filters

final signal decision

Entry logic:

exact boolean conditions for long/short

Exit logic:

stop loss formulas

take profit logic

trailing stops

time-based exits

Filters and gates:

regime filters

liquidity filters

cooldown logic

Confidence scoring

formula or heuristic

range (e.g. 0–1, 0–100)

how confidence alters execution behavior

Include pseudocode when helpful.

4) Trade Management (Quant-Sound Guidance)

Position sizing assumptions:

fixed % risk

volatility-scaled sizing

Stop placement:

ATR-based (e.g. k × ATR)

structure-based

Take profit logic:

fixed R:R

trailing

partials

When not to trade:

low-liquidity

overlapping signals

conflicting regimes

Conservative (“beginner-safe”) parameter presets

Clearly separate what the system enforces vs what is user guidance.

5) Invalidation Rules (Critical)

Explicit invalidation criteria:

indicator violations

structure breaks

regime flips

What a failed setup looks like in practice

Post-invalidation behavior:

cooldown duration

re-entry conditions

Edge cases:

indicator saturation

flat markets

volatility spikes mid-bar

6) Examples & Edge Cases

For each strategy, provide at least two scenarios:

Textbook Valid Setup

explain signal formation

explain confidence

explain execution

Failed / Misleading Setup

explain why it fails

what warning signs appear

what the user should do

Include:

common user misinterpretations

UI elements that often confuse users

how to read warnings and confidence degradation

7) Configuration & Sensitivity Analysis

User-configurable parameters

Sensitivity notes:

what happens if lookbacks are shortened

what happens if thresholds are loosened

Safe vs unsafe ranges

Conservative / Balanced / Aggressive presets (if applicable)

Parameters that should not be changed without understanding risk

Code Fidelity Requirements

Every strategy must reference:

module name(s)

function(s)

parameter definitions

If logic is unclear or incomplete:

do not guess

list the exact files/functions that must be reviewed

Call out:

dead code

unused indicators

mismatches between UI labels and actual logic

Deliverable Format
1) Strategy Menu (Summary Table)
Strategy	Type	Best Conditions	Indicators	Risk	Typical Holding
2) Individual Strategy Pages

Use a fixed template with the sections above for every strategy.

3) Glossary

Indicators

Regime terms

Confidence scores

Warnings / error messages

Constraints

No hand-waving.

No marketing language.

No assumptions without code confirmation.

Treat this as documentation that could be used in:

user education

internal audits

regulatory review

Final Objective

Produce a strategy guide that doubles as a quant-grade validation document, such that:

If a strategy behaves unexpectedly in production, this document explains why.

Now generate the strategy guide for all strategies currently implemented in the system.
